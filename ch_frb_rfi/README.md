### Transform Chain Version 1.6

Version History:

   - 1.6: Introduced auxiliary chains, new logic for controlling the buffer and negative rfi_levels.

   - 1.5: An advanced chain with fine-tuned parameters. Tested on *days* of incoherent-beam acquisitions by the CHIME Pathfinder. 

   - 1.4: Intended for the 16K-upchannelized intensity data from the John A. Galt telescope (26m).

   - 1.3: Implemented fast C++ algorithms. Tested on incoherent-beam acquisitions by the CHIME Pathfinder.

   - 1.2: Early attempts based on 1K intensity data from the CHIME Pathfinder.
