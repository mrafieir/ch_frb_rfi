# This is a simple bonsai paramfile for CHIME.
#
# Since it assumes 1024 frequency channels (rather than 16K) the
# computational cost is much lower than what we expect on the real
# L1 node.
#
# The search uses a singled downsampled tree at native resolution, max DM 276.
# This is artificially low and I'll improve it later!
#
# Currently the bonsai dedisperser requires its config.txt file to
# be processed into a config.hdf5 file (containing a binary array of
# trigger variances).  Furthermore the output triggers won't be correctly 
# normalized to "sigmas".  This is because triggers variance estimation is 
# currently unimplemented in bonsai.  I plan to fix this soon!  In the
# meantime, you'll need to make the hdf5 file with 'bonsai-mkweight'.
