# This bonsai config is convenient for offline analysis of pulsars.
#
# It is the same as bonsai_production_ups_nbeta2_v2.txt, except that it has been modified
# to stop at max DM 205, rather than 13000!  (This is done by getting rid of all trees besides
# the first, and truncating the first tree at tree_size=8192 instead of 32768.)
